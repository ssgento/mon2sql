SELECT Your query seems to be incomplete. However, based on the information provided, I can infer that you might be looking for a query that selects the airport name and city of airports that have flights from a specific airline. Assuming that the airline's abbreviation is 'XYZ', the query could look something like this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT airports.airportname, airports.city FROM airports JOIN flights ON airports.airportname = flights.sourceairport WHERE flights.airline = 'XYZ'; ``` This query will return the names and cities of all airports that have flights from the airline with the abbreviation 'XYZ'. Please replace 'XYZ' with the actual abbreviation of the airline you are interested in.

SELECT Your SQL query seems to be incomplete. However, based on the tables and properties you've provided, I can provide a general example of how you might structure a SQL query. Please provide the specific question or the missing part of the query for a more accurate response. Here's an example of how you might structure a SQL query: ```sql SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field WHERE condition GROUP BY column1 HAVING condition ORDER BY column1, column2 ASC; ``` Please replace `column1, column2, ...` with the actual columns you want to select, `table1, table2, ...` with the actual tables you want to join, `common_field` with the actual field you want to join on, `condition` with the actual condition you want to filter by, and so on.

SELECT Your SQL query seems to be incomplete. However, based on the information provided, I can infer that you might be looking for a query that retrieves the title of films rented by customers who are also staff members. Assuming that the rental table has a customer_id column, the query might look something like this: ```sql SELECT film.title FROM film JOIN film_actor ON film.film_id = film_actor.film_id JOIN actor ON film_actor.actor_id = actor.actor_id JOIN rental ON film.film_id = rental.film_id JOIN customer ON rental.customer_id = customer.customer_id JOIN staff ON rental.staff_id = staff.staff_id WHERE customer.customer_id = staff.staff_id; ``` Please note that this query assumes that the customer_id in the customer table is the same as the staff_id in the staff table, which is not a standard practice. In a real-world scenario, you would need to adjust the query to match the correct columns.

SELECT Your question seems to be in a language that is not clear to me. However, based on the tables and properties you provided, I can infer that you might be asking for the name of the storm that caused the most damage in USD, the number of deaths caused by the storm, and the maximum speed of the storm. Here is the SQL query that would answer this question: ```sql SELECT storm.name, storm.damage_millions_usd, storm.number_deaths, storm.max_speed FROM storm ORDER BY storm.damage_millions_usd DESC, storm.number_deaths DESC, storm.max_speed DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query will return the storm with the highest damage in USD, the most deaths caused by the storm, and the highest maximum speed of the storm. If there are multiple storms with the same highest damage, deaths, and speed, this query will return one of them.

SELECT Your query seems to be incomplete. However, based on the information provided, I can provide a general SQL query that might be useful. This query will select the name of the business, the review count, and the rating from the business table, where the business_id matches in the review and checkin tables. ```sql SELECT business.name, business.review_count, business.rating FROM business JOIN review ON business.business_id = review.business_id JOIN checkin ON business.business_id = checkin.business_id WHERE review.rating > 4 AND checkin.count > 100; ``` This query will return the name, review count, and rating of businesses that have received a rating of more than 4 and have had more than 100 check-ins.
SELECT Your SQL query should be: ```sql SELECT business.name, COUNT(DISTINCT review.rid) as review_count, AVG(review.rating) as average_rating FROM business JOIN review ON review.business_id = business.business_id GROUP BY business.name HAVING review_count > 100 ORDER BY average_rating DESC LIMIT 10; ``` This query selects the name of the business, the number of distinct reviews, and the average rating of the reviews for each business that has more than 100 reviews. The results are ordered by the average rating in descending order and limited to the top 10.

SELECT Your SQL query seems to be incomplete. However, based on the information provided, I can infer that you might be looking for businesses that have a rating of 3.5 or higher, and that have been reviewed by users who have left tips. Here's a possible SQL query: ```sql SELECT business.name FROM business JOIN review ON business.bid = review.business_id JOIN user ON review.user_id = user.user_id JOIN tip ON user.user_id = tip.user_id WHERE business.rating >= 3.5 GROUP BY business.name HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT tip.tip_id) > 0; ``` This query selects the names of businesses that have a rating of 3.5 or higher, and that have at least one user who has left a tip. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by business name, and the `HAVING` clause filters out businesses that have no tips.
