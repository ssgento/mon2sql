SELECT Your request is a bit unclear. However, based on the information provided, it seems you want to perform a SQL query on the given tables. However, without a specific question or task, it's hard to provide a precise SQL query. If you want to select all columns from a table, you can use the following query: ```sql SELECT * FROM table_name; ``` Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to select from. If you want to select specific columns, you can specify them in the SELECT statement: ```sql SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name; ``` Replace `column1` and `column2` with the names of the columns you want to select. If you need a more specific query, please provide more details about what you want to achieve.

Here's an example of how you might structure a query to retrieve some data from these tables: ```sql SELECT transactions.transaction_id, investors.investor_details, transactions.date_of_transaction, transactions.amount_of_transaction, transactions.share_count, transactions.other_details, ref_transaction_types.transaction_type_description FROM transactions JOIN investors ON transactions.investor_id = investors.investor_id JOIN ref_transaction_types ON transactions.transaction_type_code = ref_transaction_types.transaction_type_code WHERE transactions.transaction_type_code = 'PUR'; ``` This query selects transaction details for transactions of type 'PUR' (which presumably stands for 'purchase'), along with the investor details and transaction type description. Please replace the table and column names with the actual ones you have in your database, and adjust the WHERE clause to match your specific requirements.
